## ✅ Problem Solved
| Problem | LeetCode # | Description |
|:--|:--:|:--|
| [Partition Array According to Given Pivot](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-according-to-given-pivot/) | #2161 | Rearrange the array so that all elements less than the pivot come first, followed by equal elements, and then greater elements — while maintaining their original order. |

---

## 💡 Concepts Practiced
- **Stable partitioning** (preserving relative order)  
- Dividing elements into **three logical groups** — less than, equal to, and greater than pivot  
- Combining the groups back into a **single result array**  
- Strengthened logic building for **pivot-based array problems**  
- Achieved clean and simple **O(n)** time complexity  
- Used **ArrayList** for flexible element handling before merging
