## 💡 Concepts Practiced
- **Binary Search** implementation in both directions  
- Finding **first and last occurrence** efficiently  
- Understanding **mid-pointer adjustment** logic  
- Handling cases where the **target doesn’t exist** (`[-1, -1]`)  
- Achieving **O(log n)** time complexity  
- Strengthened problem-solving in **sorted array search logic**
