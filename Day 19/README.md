## 💡 Concepts Practiced
- Understood how **insertion sort** works on a linked list  
- Learned to use a **dummy node** to simplify insert operations  
- Practiced finding the **correct insertion point** for each node  
- Improved handling of **pointer manipulation** in linked lists  
- Strengthened logic building and step-by-step **node insertion**  
- Achieved a clean, readable solution with **O(n²)** time complexity
